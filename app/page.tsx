          <p>Schwab API Java Client SDK</p>

        <h2>In the Backlog</h2>
        <div>
          <p>Langhavens Securities Master</p>
          <p>A securities master translates adjusted prices and standardizes identifiers for securities. Corporate actions like stock splits and symbol name changes create inconsistencies when looking back in time to compare financial data. A securities master keeps track of all these changes and transforms the data into a normalized format with respect to time.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>Backtest Engine</p>
          <p>Past performance is no guarantee of future results, but back-testing can provide some indication of an algorithm&apos;s forecasted returns. I want to write my own implementation of a backtesting engine because so many algorithmic traders use them, and I want to understand the nitty-gritty details of how they work.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>Black-box Policy Proximal Optimization Algorithm</p>
          <p>A machine learning algorithm for trading with lots of indicators. It&apos;s not expected to be effective, but it is a great opportunity for applied research.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>F.A.Q.</h2>
        <div>
          <p>What does Langhavens mean?</p>
          <p>Langhavens is a concatenation of two surnames with great sentimental value, <i>Lang</i> and <i>Havens</i>. When distintively defined, they roughly translate to "long" and "safe place" respectively.</p>
